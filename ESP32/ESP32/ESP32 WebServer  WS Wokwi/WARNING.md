# ⚠️ Important Safety Warnings and Limitations

## General Precautions
1. This code is provided AS-IS without any warranties.
2. The WebSocket implementation may have security vulnerabilities if exposed to public networks.
3. Always test thoroughly before deploying in production environments.

## Technical Limitations
- The ESP32 has limited concurrent WebSocket connections
- WiFi connectivity affects real-time performance
- Memory constraints may affect stability with multiple clients

## Security Considerations
1. The current implementation does not include:
   - SSL/TLS encryption
   - Authentication mechanisms
   - Input validation
   
2. DO NOT use this code in security-critical applications without proper modifications.

## Best Practices
1. Keep the ESP32 firmware updated
2. Implement proper security measures if deploying on public networks
3. Monitor system resources to prevent crashes
4. Add error handling for production use

## Network Security
- Avoid exposing the WebSocket server directly to the internet
- Use a secure network configuration
- Implement proper authentication if required
- Consider adding encryption for sensitive data

## Code Limitations Example
```cpp
// Maximum concurrent WebSocket connections
#define MAX_CLIENTS 4  // Limited by ESP32 resources

// Timeout values that may need adjustment
#define WS_TIMEOUT 120000  // 2 minutes
#define RECONNECT_TIMEOUT 5000  // 5 seconds

// Memory-critical sections
void handleWebSocketMessage(void *arg, uint8_t *data, size_t len) {
  // Be careful with buffer sizes
  if (len > 512) return;  // Prevent buffer overflow
}
```

For any issues or concerns, please report them in the project repository.
